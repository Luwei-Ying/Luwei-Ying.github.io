My primary aim as an educator of political science is to foster students' abilities to identify real world puzzles and address them with scientific tools. This goal comes in two parts that are directly suggested by the discipline's name. The \emph{political} part emphasizes the importance of combining theories with real world politics. No social science exists independent of the society it analyzes. Thus, as a teacher, I make sure my students learn not only from the literature but also from real world problems. The second part is \emph{science}. Students will benefit from the ability to approach any problem critically and analytically, regardless of their future career paths.

## Undergraduate Level

* Pol Sci 20 World Politics, Spring 2023 
<details><summary>Course Overview</summary>
<p>
This course provides a broad exploration of world politics and the present-day international system. We cover key theoretical concepts in the field of international relations and discuss how empirical evidence and key historical events relate to and inform theory. The course is organized around specific substantive questions such as: why do states choose more costly armed conflict to settle disputes rather than negotiations?; why are levels of economic development among states so unequal?; how do international institutions affect conflict and cooperation?; what logic is behind the use of terrorism by political actors?; and, why do states experience civil war? Importantly, we will also learn about and apply the tools necessary to answer these questions in a rigorous and scientific way.

## Graduate Level

* Pol Sci 239 Violent Non-state Actors in World Politics, Spring 2023 
<details><summary>Course Overview</summary>
<p>
This course is broadly about conflict, militancy, and political violence. It aims to provide an in-depth understanding of Violent Non-State Actors (VNSAs), including their recruitment efforts, strategies and tactics, political and ideological motivations, internal structures, and impact on national and global politics. We will discuss classic and contemporary work on militancy by political scientists, including scholarship on the causes, dynamics, and consequences of militant violence. We will also assess how social scientists measure and quantify aspects of conflicts and wars. The overall focus is on the logic of asymmetric conflicts between states and non-state actors.
