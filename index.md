<p> I am a Fourth year Ph.D. student of Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. I broadly study international relations (conflict) and political methodology. My dissertation, How Extreme Violent Groups Win Hearts and Minds, examines the rise of global Jihadist movements and pays particular attention to Jihadist groups' media rhetorical strategy. How were Jihadist groups, like ISIS, able to quickly replenish themselves? Why do regional Islamic groups, like al-Shabaab, extensively talk about the countries with whom they never directly interact? To answer these questions, I have digitalized a database of periodicals from 50 Jihadist groups and unofficial Jihadist-minded organizations. I also apply and develop Text-As-Data and spatial analysis methods. I have won the Pi Sigma Alpha Award for the best paper presented at the 2019 MPSA conference.</p>
