<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate of Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. I study international relations, conflict, and political methodology. My research uses machine learning and statistical inference to uncover how violent organizations strategically use propaganda for mobilization and recruitment in pursuit of broader transnational influence.</p>

<p>My dissertation, <i>The Unified Strategy of Violent Organizations</i>, presents a unified framework for understanding violent groups' larger strategies that bind their propaganda to their military fortunes. Specifically, I focus on jihadi organizations, building an original database of 121 magazines and newsletters published by 38 different groups in 11 languages between 1984 and 2019---the largest collection of this kind. In sharp contrast to popular views that bind Islamism and violence together, I provide systematic, quantitative evidence that religion is most emphasized when radicals commit the least attacks. Overall, this in-depth study provides much needed clarity over the strategies that religious movements have used to rise to global prominence in the last several decades.</p>

<p>My other projects broadly examine the causes and consequences of political violence. My research agenda also involves advancing quantitative methodologies, including the text-as-data and GIS methods.</p>

<p>I hold a M.A. in Political Science from Washington University in St. Louis, a B.A. in international Politics and a B.A. in Journalism & Communication (with honors) from Tsinghua University. My papers have been awarded the Best Paper in International Relations Award, the Pi Sigma Alpha Award for the best paper presented at the 2019 MPSA Conference, and the Best Poster Award (Application) at the PolMeth XXXVII Summer Meeting. My published work has appeared in <i>Political Analysis</i> and twice in the <i>Journal of Conflict Resolution</i>.</p>
