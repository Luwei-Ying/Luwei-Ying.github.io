<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
Political borders profoundly influence outcomes central to international politics. Accordingly, a growing literature shows that historical boundaries affect important macro-outcomes such as patterns of interstate disputes and trade. To explain these findings, existing theories posit that borders have persistent effects on individual-level behavior, but the literature lacks empirical evidence of such effects. Combining spatial data on centuries of border changes in Europe with a wide range of contemporary survey evidence, we show that historical border changes have persistent effects on two of the most politically significant aspects of behavior: individuals’ political and social trust. We demonstrate that in areas where borders frequently changed, individuals are, on average, less trusting of others as well as their governments. We argue that this occurs because border changes disrupt historical state-building processes and limit the formation of interpersonal social networks, which leads to lower levels of trust.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
Topic models, as developed in computer science, are effective tools for exploring andsummarizing large document collections. When applied in social science research, how-ever, they are commonly used for measurement, a task that requires careful validationto ensure that the model outputs actually capture the desired concept of interest. Inthis paper, we review current practices for topic validation in the field and show thatextensive model validation is increasingly rare, or at least not systematically reported.To supplement current practices, we refine an existing crowd-sourcing method for validating topic quality (Chang et al., 2009) and go on to create new procedures forvalidating conceptual labels provided by the researcher. We illustrate our method withan analysis of Facebook posts by U.S. Senators and provide software and guidance forresearchers wishing to validate their own topic models. While tailored,  case-specificvalidation exercises will always be best, we aim to improve standard practices by providing general-purpose tools to validate topics as measures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
Political scientists and policy-makers have long argued that state weakness leads to civil confl ict while enhancing state power helps prevent violence. Why, then, has increased state capacity worldwide recently coincided with more civil conflicts? This study argues that enhanced state presence at the sub-national level -- a symptom of growing state capacity -- may induce violent resistance from the established non-state powers such as local leaders and communities in the short term. Empirically, I conduct two analyses, one at the province level and the other at the ethnic group level. To measure state presence, I use accuracy of census data in the first analysis and global ground transportation data in the second analysis. Results demonstrate that increased state presence triggers civil conflict, particularly in the first five years of such increasing state presence, and this effect is stronger in remote and ethnically heterogeneous regions. Evidence also suggests that ethnic groups settled in peripheral regions are prominent resisters to state penetration. This paper thus expands prior understanding of the role of state power in civil conflicts.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
Transnational terrorism is an inherently international phenomenon as it involves attacks where the perpetrators are from a different country than the victims. Accordingly, a growing literature explains patterns in transnational attacks with a focus on international variables, for example, the presence of a border wall or alliance patterns. Despite the importance of the topic, no common empirical framework with theoretical basis has emerged to analyze the flows of transnational attacks. We propose that recent versions of the structural gravity model of transnational flows, long the workhorse model in trade economics, can be modified to provide a theoretically motivated model of the flows of transnational terrorist attacks among countries. The gravity model provides several empirical advantages for the study of international variables and transnational terrorism, for example, recent specifications allow the researcher to estimate count models that condition out all time-varying country-level confounders with fixed effects. This facilitates sidestepping the typical problem that any international variables associated with transnational flows are often correlated with omitted or imprecisely measured domestic factors, which draws their estimates into question. Moreover, we demonstrate that the structural gravity model does a much better job in predicting outcomes, particularly when multiple attacks flow across borders.

* The Unified Strategy of Religious Extremists: Military Power and Ideological Appeals, submitted
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
Religious extremism is the dominant ideology among contemporary violent non-state actors. However, we know little about religious extremists' strategy in making ideological appeals. This paper studies jihadi groups' ideology as reflected in propaganda and shows that these groups shift on a "religious vs. secular"  spectrum according to the wax and wane of their military power. Weaker groups must prioritize their core fanatic believers and foreground a more radical religious ideal, while stronger groups seek broader support from more moderate individuals and thus pitch themselves more secularly. I illustrate this dynamic with an original database of 84 magazines published regularly by 38 jihadi groups from 1984 to 2019. Further, I leverage approximately 6 million tweets from 21 thousand ISIS-related accounts in 2015 to examine the jihadists' mobilization efforts regarding different audiences. Overall, in sharp contrast to the prevailing view that radical jihadi ideology and violence are bound together, I demonstrate that groups rhetorically emphasize religion when they carry out fewer attacks.

* Democracy versus Authoritarianism?: How Regime Type Shapes US-China Competition for UNGA Voting Alignment (with Xun Pang), submitted
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
The foreign policy division between democratic and authoritarian countries is one of the most studied cleavages in international politics, and the current discussion centers on whether the great power competition between the United States and China divides the world along regime lines. This paper focuses on the US-China competition in forming voting alignments in the United Nations General Assembly and disentangles the effects of regime type on actions, preferences, and strategic calculations of the rival powers and developing countries. We develop a formal model to theorize the competition and convert the game into a Bayesian statistical estimator. Empirical evidence suggests that the US-China competition increases the democracy/authoritarianism voting cleavage. States' regime-oriented voting or vote-buying choices, however, are not driven by their sincere preferences but by differential strategies shaped by regime type. These findings shed light on the nature of the US-China competition and its implications for the world order.

* Diversity via Coercion: How Historical Displacement Shapes Contemporary Politics (with David B. Carter and Austin L. Wright)
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
Coercive mass-scale population relocation is a prominent historical feature of state-building. Regimes move racial, ethnic, or linguistic groups through various means but the most common political dynamic underlying displacement is intent: consolidation of political control. We evaluate the long-run consequences of mass-scale displacement leveraging a historical episode in Afghanistan: the relocation of Pashtun communities during the rule of Emir Abd-al Rahman. This relocation effort was intended to extend the political authority of the Pashtun majority in areas of ethnic diversity in the north. Using historical records, we reconstruct the map of relocated tribes and leverage novel, microlevel survey data on more than 80,000 subjects to study how contemporary attitudes towards the central government, the Taliban, and identity salience differ across co-ethnic communities separated by the Emir's state-building effort more than a century ago. Contrary to prior work, we find that relocated Pashtuns are more critical of the central government <i>and</i> the Taliban yet are more likely to identify as Afghans (relative their ethnic or tribal affiliation). These results survive a battery of robustness checks and clarify the long-run political consequences of mass-scale resettlement in a highly relevant political context.
