White nationalist extremism is an increasingly dangerous global security threat. Yet how white nationalist leaders deploy ideological rhetoric online to sustain and expand their support base remains poorly understood. We theorize that leaders retain a central role in this decentralized movement, using their online platforms to consolidate and grow support through appeals emphasizing distinct elements of white nationalist ideology. To test this theory, we analyze 16,627,018 Twitter and Gab posts (2016–2021) from 64 U.S. white nationalist leaders and 11,303 followers. Our results show that leaders are highly influential: when they highlight specific issues, followers soon post similar content. Moreover, gendered rhetoric serves as a particularly powerful mainstream gateway appeal— even more than partisanship—engaging peripheral followers and prompting followers to post more racialized content. These results reveal how white nationalist leaders shape and market extremist ideology online and build follower networks, with important implications for understanding and disrupting radicalization.

The globalization backlash and the recent success of populist parties in developed countries are typically explained by current economic or cultural grievances. This research note highlights an overlooked historical factor: the frequency of historical border changes in a locality. Using newly compiled post-World War II election data at the NUTS 3 level in Europe and data on five centuries of border changes, we show that localities with greater historical border instability consistently vote for populist parties at higher rates, even when accounting for recent economic conditions. We argue that historical border changes disrupted local state-building processes, leading to entrenched perceptions of poor governance. We corroborate this using survey evidence, and find that individuals in historically unstable areas do not reject democratic principles but express deep dissatisfaction with how democracy is practiced in their country. These results underscore the enduring impact of long-past border disruptions on contemporary politics, suggesting that the contemporary appeal of populism is at least partly explained by the legacies of international politics.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
The proliferation of terrorist propaganda threatens societies worldwide. Yet, we know little about violent extremists' strategy in disseminating their ideologies. This paper studies the ideological appeals of jihadi groups, among the most prominent contemporary conflict movements, and shows how these groups navigate between religious and secular narratives in response to the fluctuations in their military power. Weaker groups must prioritize their core believers and foreground a more radical religious ideal, while stronger groups seek broader support from more moderate individuals and thus pitch themselves more secularly. I illustrate this dynamic with an original database of 87 magazines published regularly by 35 jihadi groups from 1984 to 2019. Further, I leverage approximately 6 million tweets from 21,000 ISIS-related accounts in 2015 to examine the jihadists' mobilization efforts regarding different audiences. Overall, I demonstrate that violent groups put more emphasis on their ideological brand when they are militarily weaker.

Political borders profoundly influence outcomes central to international politics. Accordingly, a growing literature shows that historical boundaries affect important macro-outcomes such as patterns of interstate disputes and trade. To explain these findings, existing theories posit that borders have persistent effects on individual-level behavior, but the literature lacks empirical evidence of such effects. Combining spatial data on centuries of border changes in Europe with a wide range of contemporary survey evidence, we show that historical border changes have persistent effects on two of the most politically significant aspects of behavior: individuals’ political and social trust. We demonstrate that in areas where borders frequently changed, individuals are, on average, less trusting of others as well as their governments. We argue that this occurs because border changes disrupt historical state-building processes and limit the formation of interpersonal social networks, which leads to lower levels of trust.

Topic models, as developed in computer science, are effective tools for exploring andsummarizing large document collections. When applied in social science research, how-ever, they are commonly used for measurement, a task that requires careful validationto ensure that the model outputs actually capture the desired concept of interest. Inthis paper, we review current practices for topic validation in the field and show thatextensive model validation is increasingly rare, or at least not systematically reported.To supplement current practices, we refine an existing crowd-sourcing method for validating topic quality (Chang et al., 2009) and go on to create new procedures forvalidating conceptual labels provided by the researcher. We illustrate our method withan analysis of Facebook posts by U.S. Senators and provide software and guidance forresearchers wishing to validate their own topic models. While tailored,  case-specificvalidation exercises will always be best, we aim to improve standard practices by providing general-purpose tools to validate topics as measures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
Political scientists and policy-makers have long argued that state weakness leads to civil confl ict while enhancing state power helps prevent violence. Why, then, has increased state capacity worldwide recently coincided with more civil conflicts? This study argues that enhanced state presence at the sub-national level -- a symptom of growing state capacity -- may induce violent resistance from the established non-state powers such as local leaders and communities in the short term. Empirically, I conduct two analyses, one at the province level and the other at the ethnic group level. To measure state presence, I use accuracy of census data in the first analysis and global ground transportation data in the second analysis. Results demonstrate that increased state presence triggers civil conflict, particularly in the first five years of such increasing state presence, and this effect is stronger in remote and ethnically heterogeneous regions. Evidence also suggests that ethnic groups settled in peripheral regions are prominent resisters to state penetration. This paper thus expands prior understanding of the role of state power in civil conflicts.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
Transnational terrorism is an inherently international phenomenon as it involves attacks where the perpetrators are from a different country than the victims. Accordingly, a growing literature explains patterns in transnational attacks with a focus on international variables, for example, the presence of a border wall or alliance patterns. Despite the importance of the topic, no common empirical framework with theoretical basis has emerged to analyze the flows of transnational attacks. We propose that recent versions of the structural gravity model of transnational flows, long the workhorse model in trade economics, can be modified to provide a theoretically motivated model of the flows of transnational terrorist attacks among countries. The gravity model provides several empirical advantages for the study of international variables and transnational terrorism, for example, recent specifications allow the researcher to estimate count models that condition out all time-varying country-level confounders with fixed effects. This facilitates sidestepping the typical problem that any international variables associated with transnational flows are often correlated with omitted or imprecisely measured domestic factors, which draws their estimates into question. Moreover, we demonstrate that the structural gravity model does a much better job in predicting outcomes, particularly when multiple attacks flow across borders.
